          <p>Pure functions are easy to test.</p>
          <p>And so are classes with few dependencies.</p>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - a pure function is a function that has no side effects.
            - that has a very clear relationship between input and output
            - and in the previous example the class was instantiated without any dependencies

          <p>What about this one?</p>
          <pre><code>
        export default class RockPaperScissors {
          constructor(ui, humanPlayer, computerPlayer) {
            this.ui = ui
            this.humanPlayer = humanPlayer
            this.computerPlayer = computerPlayer
          }

          run() {
            this.ui.greet()
            this.play()
          }

          // ...
        }
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - look at the constructor of this class
            - it is dependent on three other classes
            - which doesn't sound too bad at first glance
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But when we look at this...</p>
          <pre><code>
  const consoleInput = require('prompt-sync')()
  const consoleOutput = console
  const ui = new Ui(consoleInput, consoleOutput)
  const game = new RockPaperScissors(ui,
                                     new HumanPlayer(ui),
                                     new ComputerPlayer())
  game.run()
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - turns out that the Ui has some dependencies too
            - so now we're up to five dependencies
            - and the HumanPlayer is dependent on the ui as well
            - obviously this is just a little illustrative example
            - but you can see how dependencies can soon become quite a lot
            - and do you really want to instantiate all of those in your tests when all you want to test is the RockPaperScissors class?
            - spoiler alert, the answer is no...
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Or what about this one?</p>
          <pre><code>
fetchData() {
  const url = `${urlPrefix}?criteria=${this.filterCriteria()}`
  return window.fetch(url,
                      {credentials: 'same-origin',
                       cache: 'no-store'}
                     ).then(result => result.json())
}
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - let's say you want to test that the fetch call was made with the correct url
            - with the correct filter criteria
            - but every time you run this function, you would actually make a fetch call to that specific URL
            - which could be a bit of an issue, for example if you have to pay for each fetch
            - or if you run your tests all the time (which you probably will because you're test driving your code)
            - you might be sending too many requests

            - when I first came across this concept, my mind was blown
            - but before I delve into the main part of this presentation
            - here's something I prepared earlier for you
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What is a test double?</h2>

        <section>
          <h2>Why do we use them?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">To reduce the amount of dependencies</li>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let's look at one of our examples again.</p>
          <pre><code>
  const consoleInput = require('prompt-sync')()
  const consoleOutput = console
  const ui = new Ui(consoleInput, consoleOutput)
  const game = new RockPaperScissors(ui,
                                     new HumanPlayer(ui),
                                     new ComputerPlayer())
  game.run()
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            - in this case the Ui is the trouble some collaborator
            - but we can replace the Ui with a test double
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors with test doubles</p>
          <pre><code>
  const uiDouble = new UiDouble(false)
  const fakeComputer = new FakePlayer('rock', null)
  const fakeHuman = new FakePlayer('paper', ['n'])
  const game = new RockPaperScissors(uiDouble,
                                     fakeHuman,
                                     fakeComputer)
  game.run()
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - this time using a test double
            - a bit easier
            - only one type of human player necessary
            - you can already guess that we're forcing our players to play a certain move
            - no dependencies for the ui

            - colloquially they're often called mocks
            - there are loads of "mocking libraries"

            - I don't write my own test doubles all the time
            - but I thought it would be interesting to demo this in this presentation
            - normally I use the spies and fakes and what not that Jasmine provides
            - but hopefully this has helped you to understand better what's happening under the hood
