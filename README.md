# Of spies, fakes and friends - help your code lead a double life

### A presentation about test doubles, how to use them and how to name them correctly.

With lots of JavaScript code examples, mainly from [this repo](https://github.com/RabeaGleissner/rock-paper-scissors-js).

I originally prepared this presentation for the [JS Monthly meetup](https://www.meetup.com/js-monthly/events/243897273/) in London.

I also wrote [a blog post](http://rabea.co.uk/blog/apprenticeship/post-101) about this topic a while ago.

## Shout out

I'm using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). Big thanks to [Hakim El Hattab](https://hakim.se/) for providing this open source presentation framework.
